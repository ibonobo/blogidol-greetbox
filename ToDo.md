# Introduction #

At first, I decided to update Kaushnik's code by hosting it myself. It makes little sense to host it on a webhost when Google provides such an amazing vehicle for working on code.


# Details #

The WP version currently supports the following referrers, while the Blogger version supports fewer (though since the article has been released, Kaushik may have updated the script without updating the article).

## Flexibility ##
The primary goal is to allow for greeting visitors based on undefined (but existent referrer), using that site's favicon.ico (usually found in the root directory of said site.

## Translate and add specific referrers ##
Once translated in various languages, it becomes necessary to define referrers for that particular locale, such as specific aggregators and search engines.

When properly installed, this plugin will display a personalized message to each visitor depending on where they come from (referrer). For instance, if they have come via a Google search, they will see "welcome googler" followed by an invitation to subscribe to the blog. Similarly, when a reddit user clicks through from reddit, they will see a message reminding them to digg your post if they like it. Such targeted suggestions make visitors feel special, above the crowd and could potentially help your blog increase exposure, loyal readership and reader interaction thus increasing your page hits.
